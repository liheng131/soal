Hi Mike,

I noticed you've been leading agile and Scrum training at Mountain Goat Software since 2000, helping companies adopt and succeed with agile software development. How do you see AI impacting the future of agile project management?

Having worked in AI for customer support for several years, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to streamline customer interactions.
But when done right, it can make a huge difference in efficiency and customer satisfaction.

I’ve developed AI solutions that transform customer support processes and help companies handle customer inquiries more effectively.
If you're curious about how this can work for you, I’d be glad to share more. 

If interested, just shoot me a reply.

Thanks, Oskar
